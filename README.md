## Product Listing Classification Model

Walkthrough of my initial solution to a spam classification challenge. The challenge was requested from a technology company who owns a popular online marketplace application. To stand out from the crowd, sellers would employ creative, sometimes disruptive efforts to improve their search relevancy or attract the attention of potential buyers. These product listings would degenerate user experience by cluttering the app with irrelevant, misleading information.

The challenge requested this problem be tackled as a binary classification (spam or ham) problem. The repo
contains my walkthrough of a bag-of-words based solution (via Jupyter notebook).
